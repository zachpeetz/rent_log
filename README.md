This project was to keep rent payments on track, making sure everything was even for each tenant.

rent.py  - contains Python source code that reads in a CSV file and manipulates the information to give desired output
rent_payments.csv - rent logs within a CSV format
Makefile - used to quickly retrieve wanted information
